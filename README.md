### Hey üëã, I'm Christian!

I love building stuff, currently working on a startup, building a data and machine learning platform. 

I'm a generalist that can transform into an expert on a case by case manner. My background as a physicist makes it natural for me to observe the surroundings from a macroscopic level, but I am always prepared to zoom in on a microscopic level. My strength relies on my dedication to dissecting a particular subject and later applying my broad set of skills and experience to implement it from the ground up. 

My professional expertise and interests includes
* building databases and data processing tools with focus on efficiency and flexibility, including things like parsing, query engine/execution, etl/elt pipelines, compression, storage, ‚Äúprofiler-driven-development‚Äù, assembly, ...
* building products from idea to production (full stack). Good sense of how web related techniques work in isolation or as blocks in larger systems; backend, APIs,  networking, frontend, protocols, encoding, infrastructure, ‚Ä¶

My favorite programming language is go. Learning zig and rust.

Some inspiring people and blogs I'm following and revisiting now and then
* Daniel Lemire blogging about performance hacks and interesting CS stuff https://lemire.me/blog/
* Andy Pavlo. Researcher and teacher at Carnegie Mellon University. Awesome database course material available. https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/
* http://erikdemaine.org/. Awesome course on advanced data structures and algorithms https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.851/spring21/
* Creel on youtube. Great assembly videos. https://www.youtube.com/c/WhatsACreel
* D. Richard Hipp, creator of sqlite. 

Good stuff from compression community
* Overview / Forum https://encode.su/threads/2078-List-of-Asymmetric-Numeral-Systems-implementations. 
* Fastcompression, Yann Collet's blog about compression, the inventor of lz4 and zstd. http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/ 
* There is a lot of good stuff available on compression in general. Other influential people are Fabian Gleisen and Charles Bloom. 
* Good blog post on arithmetic coders and rANS. https://kedartatwawadi.github.io/post--ANS/ 
* The Alias Method for Sampling from Discrete Distribution http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2012/08/lab-notes-the-a.html
